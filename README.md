# HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data.

## 🚀 Models Used
- Random Forest
- Neural Network
- XGBoost

Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## 📁 Files
- `random_forest_model.pkl` – Saved Random Forest model
- `neural_network_model.pkl` – Saved Neural Network model
- `xgboost_model.pkl` – Saved XGBoost model
- `HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION.ipynb` – Main notebook with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization

## 📊 Features
- Classification performance comparison
- Confusion matrix plots
- Hyperparameter tuning
- GitHub + Google Colab integration
- Model export as `.pkl` files

## 🧠 Dataset
This project uses a heart disease dataset with features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.

## 📌 How to Use
Run the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Train models, compare results, and export them for deployment or analysis.
